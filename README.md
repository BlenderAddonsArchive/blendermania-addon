# Blender Addon for Trackmania and ManiaPlanet
This addon is for Blender 2.93+, it will simplify all necessary steps and help you with:
- creating icons from different perspectives
- creating materials which have the game textures applied in blender automatically (if downloaded)
- download and install the game textures(zip/dds) and the nadeoimporter.exe with one click
- export your blocks with one click in the right folders (collections are exported, not the objects!)
- convert your exported blocks with one click, with progressbar and error reporting
- documentation (in dev...) https://images.mania.exchange/com/skyslide/Blender-Addon-Tutorial/
